## About

My portfolio made in HTML, SASS and JS(bundled with webpack/mix). Using NodeJS as webserver. NPM dependencies is built, compiled and stored during the build stage of the pipline. It is then deployed with DIND(Docker-in-docker/compose). Layout for the portfolio is inspired by the tutorial Sass - CSS with superpowers.
